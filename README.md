## Introduction

<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="resources/lynx.png">

Lynx is a chess engine developed by [@eduherminio](https://github.com/eduherminio).

It's written in C# (.NET 6).

You can find Lynx:

- As a [lichess bot](https://lichess.org/@/Lynx_BOT).

- As a self-contained executable, downloadable from [Releases](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/releases).

Lichess bot can be played directly, but a chess GUI that supports UCI protocol is needed to play against the self-contained version.

## Building Lynx

Requirements:

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0). You can find instructions about how to install it in your preferred OS/Distro either [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/) or [here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/main/release-notes/6.0).

Instructions:

- Run `make` to build a self-contained binary similar to the pre-compiled ones.

  Disclaimer: I do not use the Makefile myself, which means it is not fully tested and may occasionally get out of date.

- Alternatively, you can get the exact `dotnet publish (...)` command from [`release.yml`](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) that is used by the CI to create the binaries and run it yourself (with the right [runtime identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#using-rids)).

   Examples:

  ```bash
  dotnet publish src/Lynx.Cli/Lynx.Cli.csproj -c Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained /p:Optimized=true -o /home/your_user/engines/Lynx
  dotnet publish src/Lynx.Cli/Lynx.Cli.csproj -c Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained /p:Optimized=true -o C:/Users/your_user/engines/Lynx
  ```

Lynx development is heavily influenced by [`BitBoard Chess Engine in C` YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmN0neTso3Jxh8ZIylk74JpwfiWNI76Cs), where [@maksimKorzh](https://github.com/maksimKorzh) explains how he developed his [BBC](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/bbc) engine.
