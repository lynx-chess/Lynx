## Introduction

<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="resources/lynx.png">

Lynx is a chess engine developed by [@eduherminio](https://github.com/eduherminio).

It's written in C# (.NET 9).

You can find Lynx:

- As a [lichess bot](https://lichess.org/@/Lynx_BOT).

- As a self-contained executable, downloadable from [Releases](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/releases).

Lichess bot can be played directly, but a chess GUI that supports UCI protocol is needed to play against the self-contained version.

## Strength

See [Releases](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/releases) for the complete list of versions.

Here are the ones 'properly' rated over at least a few hundred of games:

## Building Lynx

[Lynx release artifacts](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/releases) are self-contained and require no dependencies to be run.

However, you can also choose to build Lynx yourself.

### Requirements

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0). You can find instructions about how to install it in your preferred OS/Distro either [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/) or [here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/main/release-notes/9.0).

If you're a Linux user and are new to .NET ecosystem, the conversation in [this issue](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/issues/33) may help.

### Instructions

- Clone the repo, and preferably checkout one of the [released tags](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/releases).

- Run `make` to build a self-contained binary similar to the pre-compiled ones.

  Disclaimer: I do not use the Makefile myself, which means it is not fully tested and may occasionally get out of date.

- Alternatively, you can get the exact `dotnet publish (...)` command from [`release.yml`](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) that is used by the CI to create the binaries and run it yourself (with the right [runtime identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#using-rids)).

  Examples:

  ```bash
  dotnet publish src/Lynx.Cli/Lynx.Cli.csproj -c Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained /p:Optimized=true -o /home/your_user/engines/Lynx
  dotnet publish src/Lynx.Cli/Lynx.Cli.csproj -c Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained /p:Optimized=true -o C:/Users/your_user/engines/Lynx
  ```

- The previous steps will generate an executable named `Lynx.Cli(.exe)` and a settings file named `appsettings.json`, which are enough to run Lynx chess engine.

## Multithreaded search

Lynx supports the usage of multiple threads for searching since [v1.8.0](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/releases/tag/v1.8.0).

It can be configured using `Threads` UCI command or via `appsettings.json` configuration file. A change in `Threads` using UCI will only take place after a `ucinewgame` command is sent to the engine (same behavior as with `Hash` command).

It's interesting to measure how much strength an engine gains when you allow it to use more cores (see Stockfish's [Threading efficiency and Elo gain](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki/Useful-data#threading-efficiency-and-elo-gain))

This is how Lynx v1.8.0 scales with multiple threads (elo measured playing against itself N threads vs 1 using a balanced book, see links for details):

## Pondering / permanent brain

Lynx supports pondering/permanent brain since [v1.5.0](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

It can be enabled using `Ponder` UCI command or via `appsettings.json` configuration file. The engine doesn't ponder by default even if `Ponder` flag is enabled, it only does so when receiving a `go` command with a request to ponder.

CEGT maintains a [pondering rating list](http://www.cegt.net/5Plus3Rating/BestVersionsNEW/rangliste.html).

v1.8.0 results of pondering vs no-pondering (40+0.4, Hash 256, balanced book):

```log
Score of Lynx 1.8.0 vs Lynx 1.8.0: 552 - 218 - 1730  [0.567] 2500
...      Lynx 1.8.0 playing White: 329 - 83 - 839  [0.598] 1251
...      Lynx 1.8.0 playing Black: 223 - 135 - 891  [0.535] 1249
...      White vs Black: 464 - 306 - 1730  [0.532] 2500
Elo difference: 46.7 +/- 7.5, LOS: 100.0 %, DrawRatio: 69.2 %
SPRT: llr 0 (0.0%), lbound -inf, ubound inf
```

Pondering can be enabled together with multithreading.

v1.8.0 results of 2 threads + pondering vs 1 thread (40+0.4, Hash 256, balanced book):

## Non-standard UCI commands

The following non-standard UCI commands are supported:

- `bench`: searches a predetermined set of positions at a certain depth and returns the number of searched nodes, as well as the nodes per second (nps) based on the time the search took.

- `verbosebench`: `bench`, but showing the actual engine output.

- `fen`: shows the current position's FEN.

- `eval`: shows the current position's static evaluation.

- `printsysteminfo`: shows some internal behavior based on the system where Lynx is running.

## Credits

Lynx development would simply not have been possible without:

- [`BitBoard Chess Engine in C` YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmN0neTso3Jxh8ZIylk74JpwfiWNI76Cs), where [@maksimKorzh](https://github.com/maksimKorzh) explains how he developed his [BBC](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/bbc) engine

- [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/)

I would also like to extend my gratitude to:

- Engine Programming discord group. Without it, Lynx wouldn't be as strong as it is nowadays. Especial mention for Jamie Whiting
([Akimbo](https://github.com/JacquesRW/akimbo)), Antares ([Altair](https://github.com/Alex2262/AltairChessEngine)), Ciekce ([Stormphrax](https://github.com/Ciekce/Stormphrax/)), Rak ([Mess](https://github.com/raklaptudirm/mess)), mcthouacbb ([Sirius](https://github.com/mcthouacbb/Sirius)), CJ ([Alexandria](https://github.com/PGG106/Alexandria)), etc.

- The community Discord around [SebLague/Chess-Challenge](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge/), which allowed me to discover EP discord and to revisit the basics, this time explained by very knowledgeable developers (such as the ones above) to people without any previous chess engine programming knowledge

- Marcel Vanthoor and [his blog about how he created his engine, Rustic](https://rustic-chess.org/)

- Gedas for his [texel-tuner](https://github.com/GediminasMasaitis/texel-tuner) tool

- SF developers for their [WDL_model](https://github.com/official-stockfish/WDL_model) tool

- Andrew Grant for [OpenBench](https://github.com/AndyGrant/OpenBench)

- lichess developers for [lichess-bot](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot)

- Open source chess engines with permissive licenses. Their existence encourages knowledge sharing and really helps pushing the Chess Engine Developer community forward. Some engines are credited inside the codebase itself, where relevant

- Countless other developers and online resources, who/which I should probably remember, but don't come to my mind right now

Thanks also to all the testers that invest their time in computer chess, especially those ones that test lower rated engines (as opposed to only top ones).
